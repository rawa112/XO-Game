# XO-Game
The XO game, also known as Tic-Tac-Toe, is a simple game for two players. It is played on a 3x3 grid. One player uses "X" and the other uses "O". Players take turns marking a square with their symbol. The goal is to get three of your symbols in a rowâ€”either across, down, or diagonally. If the grid is full and no one has three in a row, the game is a draw.
